# Legomena Research Paper

[Heap's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaps%27_law) states that in a large enough text corpus, the number of types as a function of tokens grows as $N=KM^\beta$ for some free parameters $K,\beta$. Much has been written about how this result (or variants of it) can be derived from [Zipf's Law](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law). Here we derive from first principles a completely novel expression of the type-token curve and prove its superior accuracy on real text. This expression extends quite naturally to equally accurate estimates for counting hapaxes and other $n$-legomena.
