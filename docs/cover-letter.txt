Dear Editor:

In 2009 I discovered Zipf's and Heap's Laws via Bernhardsson et al's excellent paper attempting to fingerprint authors via the model parameters given by the latter. While I found the work fascinating, I did not understand or agree with a number of points given. So I undertook the challenge of reproducing their work. In the process, my frustrations and criticisms grew to the point I had resolved to attempt to derive Heap's Law from first principles. Although I found several other papers purporting to do so, they all tended to follow the same basic formula: namely correlating Zipf's exponent α to Heap's exponent β via a variety of techniques.

During my investigations, I found that assuming Zipf's Law undoctored by any exponent at all directly led to a logarithmic (NOT exponential) type-token growth curve. Searching the literature, I found absolutely no reference to this formula whatsoever, not even in unrelated subjects. Because of the nature of my derivation, this logarithmic formula lends itself naturally to an extension predicting the counts of hapaxes, dis legomena, tris, and higher n-legomena in a text corpus. In attempting to find existing research in these areas I also came up with nothing.

Despite this dearth of findings (which was quite shocking to me, given the accessibility of the math), the formulae I found predict the counts of types, hapaxes, etc to a high degree of accuracy when benchmarking them against real corpora (the 16 books included in Python's nltk.corpus.gutenberg collection). In fact, my formulas outperformed Heap's Law to a threefold increase in accuracy, and I have yet to find a single analytic formula modeling hapaxes in the literature. Either I have failed miserably in my research, or the formulae derived in the submitted paper are both novel and more accurate than the known results.

Heap's Law appears to be an excellent first approximation to the type-token growth curve. But the formulae derived herein DO NOT rely on Heap's result or any extension or generalization. Nor do my results (to the best of my knowledge) assume or build upon any other results in the field. Heap's Law is simply an educated guess, and the results discovered so far seek to modify that guess slightly to obtain marginally better accuracy. My approach ignores Heap's Law entirely and relies solely on Zipf's Law as an unmotivated axiom. I hereby pledge that my work is my own and my results are not in any way derived or copied from the work of others. I've sought in vain to find extant references to all or part of my results.

I hypothesize that this is the "correct" type-token relation because:
- The resulting formulae outperform Heap's Law
- The types formula has two degrees of freedom, same as Heaps
- The formulae are simple, low-entropy, and highly symmetric
- The derivation is elementary and intuitive
- The formulae, taken as a class, predict a wider field of phenomena (hapaxes, etc)
- The overall accuracy of all the formulae taken as a class are consistent

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration, and I am available via email for any questions or supporting materials.
